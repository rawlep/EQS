An equation solver and parser for simple linear equations (based on www.amzi.com/articles/e-sit.doc) which I hope would be used as a basis for persons (here: http://csi.uog.edu.gy/) to use to learn haskell.  There might be bugs but the point is that the identification and fixing of bugs will be part of the learning process. In order to use the program, you would need to download haskell from here: http://www.haskell.org/platform/ and do 'ghc --make esit.hs' if you're on linux or 'ghc esit.hs' on windows.
